## Batch result callbacks
#
# The API is batch-centric for entity related calls. The general
# approach supplies a list of Entity References to a method, which then
# calls the success or failure callback for each element of that list
# with the response from the manager. In the future we plan to provide
# additional conveniences for single entity tasks, or 'list in list out'
# use cases.

    #
    #   from openassetio_mediacreation.traits.content import LocatableContentTrait
