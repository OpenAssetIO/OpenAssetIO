"""
The SampleAssetManager provides a working example of a primitive
asset management system, exposed through an OpenAssetIO ManagerPlugin.

It aims to demonstrate a canonical binding of a manager to the
OpenAssetIO API.

The actual inner workings and approach of the manager itself should
be taken with a pinch of salt though, and not used as a reference
for "how to build an asset management system". It is a minimal
implementation that serves the needs of the API for testing and
the purposes of exploring host workflows.

This package should be placed on $OPENASSETIO_PLUGIN_PATH. This does not
need to be on `$PYTHONPATH` directly, the plugin system takes care
of extending Python's runtime paths accordingly.

# It is important to minimise imports here. This module will be loaded
# when the plugin system scans for plugins. Postpone importing any
# of the actual implementation until it is needed by the
# ManagerPlugin's implementation.
