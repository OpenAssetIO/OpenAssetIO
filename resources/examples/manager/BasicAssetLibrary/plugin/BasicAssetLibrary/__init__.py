"""
The BasicAssetLibrary provides a basic "librarian" asset management
system.

It serves to provide a minimum level of functionality to allow simple
demonstrations and end-to-end tests to be realized with a little
supporting infrastructure as possible.

The BasicAssetLibrary lives in the simpler category of asset
management systems - one that is not capable of providing information
about a future entity. In that, it can not determine the primary string
(e.g. path) or any attribute for an entity that does not exist yet.
It will simply remember entities it is told about, and provide that
information through the OpenAssetIO API methods.

It is designed to be easy to bootstrap into a known state though a
simple JSON configuration file that provides the entirety of some
asset library.

This manager has no specific understanding about any kind of entity,
and consequently has no inherent hierarchy or structural understanding
of parent/child relationships. Entities are simply registered by name
in a flat global namespace.

This package should be placed on $OPENASSETIO_PLUGIN_PATH. This does not
need to be on `$PYTHONPATH` directly, the plugin system takes care
of extending Python's runtime paths accordingly.
