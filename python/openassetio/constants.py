## Field names are to be used whenever data is get or set from a dictionary by
## key, rather than through an accessor in some wrapper class (eg:
## Item/Specification etc...). Bare strings should never be used to help

##
## These fields should also be used, if necessary, when declaring derived
## classes of a @ref Specification.
