    The Session is the primary mechanism for managing the lifetime of a
    Manager. A Session should be constructed and persisted for each
    individual Manager a host wishes to communicate with.

    The useManager() function defines which Manager a session should
    use, and allows the current manager to be switched, deallocating the
    old one.

    Session settings can be saved and recalled, this includes the active
    manager and it's settings. This can be useful for persisting the
    configuration across host process invocations.

    @see openassetio.hostAPI.Session.getSettings
    @see openassetio.hostAPI.Session.setSettings

    The Session class is suitable for all Hosts, but in cases where a UI
    is presented to the user, it may be desirable to use the UISession
    instead, as it permits access to a Managers widgets etc...
