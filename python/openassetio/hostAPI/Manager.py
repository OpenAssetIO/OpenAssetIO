        This information should then be used to determine which options

    # @name Related Entities
    #
    # A 'related' entity could take many forms. For example:
    #
    #  @li In 3D CGI, Multiple AOVs or layers may be related to a 'beauty' render.
    #  @li In Compositing, an image sequence may be related to the script
    #  that created it.
    #  @li An asset may be related to a task that specifies work to be done.
    #  @li Parent/child relationships are also (semantically) covered by
    #  these relationships.
    #
    # In the this API, these relationships are represented by a generic
    # Specification, this may just be a 'type', but can additionally have
    # arbitrary attributes to further define the relationship. For example in
    # the case of AOVs, the type might be 'alternate output' and the
    # attributes may be that the 'channel' is 'diffuse'.
    #
    # Related references form a vital part in the abstraction of the internal
    # structure of the asset management system from the host application in its
    # attempts to provide the user with meaningful functionality. A good example
    # of this is in an editorial workflow, where you may need to query whether a
    # 'shot' exists in a certain part of the asset system. One approach would be
    # to use a 'getChildren' call, on this part of the system. This has the
    # drawback that is assumes that shots are always something that can be
    # described as 'immediate children' of the location in question. This lay not
    # always be the case (say, for example there is some kind of 'task' structure
    # in place too). Instead we use a request that asks for any 'shots' that
    # relate to the chosen location. It is then up to the implementation of the
    # manager to determine how that maps to its own data model. Hopefully this
    # allows a host to work with a broader range of asset management systems,
    # without providing any requirements of their structure or data model within
    # the  system itself.

    # @name Publishing
    #
    # The publishing functions allow the host to create an @ref entity within
    # the @ref asset_management_system represented by the Manager. The API is
    # designed to accommodate the broad variety of roles that different asset
    # managers embody. Some are 'librarians' that simply catalog the locations of
    # existing media. Others take an active role in both the temporary and
    # long-term paths to items they manage.
    #
    # There are two key components to publishing within this API.
    #
    # *1 - The Entity Reference*
    #
    # As with the other entry points in this API, it is assumed that an @ref
    # entity_reference is known ahead of time. How this reference is determined
    # is beyond the scope of this layer of the API, and functions exists in
    # higher levels that combine browsing and publishing etc... Here, we simply
    # assert that there must be a meaningful reference given the @ref
    # Specification of the entity that is being created or published.
    #
    # @note 'Meaningful' is best defined by the asset manager itself. For
    # example, in a system that versions each 'asset' by creating children of the
    # asset for each version, when talking about where to publish an image
    # sequence of a render to, it may make sense to reference to the Asset
    # itself, so that the system can determine the 'next' version number at the
    # time of publish. It may also make sense to reference a specific version of
    # this asset to implicitly state which version it will be written to. Other
    # entity types may not have this flexibility.
    #
    # *2 - The Specification*
    #
    # The Specification allows ancillary information to be provided to help the
    # implementation better interpret what type of entity may be best suited in
    # any given situation. For example, a path to an image will generally be
    # accompanied by with an spec, that details the file type, color space,
    # resolution etc...
    #
    # @note The Specification should *not* be confused with @ref attributes.  The
    # manager will not directly store any information contained within the
    # Specification, though it may be used to better define the type of entity.
    # If you wish to persist other properties of the published entity, you must
    # call @ref setEntityAttributes() directly instead, and as described in the
    # attributes section, this is assumed that this is the channel for information
    # that needs to be stored by the manager.
    #
    # For more on the relationship between Entities, Specifications and
    # attributes, please see @ref entities_specifications_and_attributes
    # "this" page.
    #
    # The action of 'publishing' itself, is split into two parts, depending on
    # the nature of the item to be published.
    #
    #  @li **Preflight** When you are about to create some new media/asset.
    #  @li **Registration** When you wish to publish media that exists.
    #
    # For examples of how to correctly call these parts of the
    # API, see the @ref examples page.
    #
    # @note The term '@ref publish' is somewhat loaded. It generally means
    # something different depending on who you are talking to. See the @ref
    # publish "Glossary entry" for more on this, but to help avoid confusion,
    # this API provides the @ref updateTerminology call, in order to allow the
    # Manager to standardize some of the language and terminology used in your
    # presentation of the asset management system with other integrations of the
    # system.
    #
    # *3 - Thumbnails*
    #
    # The API provides a mechanism for a manager to request a thumbnail for an
    # entity as it is being published, see: @ref thumbnails.

        Manager will understand what it means for you to call `register`
        on this reference with the supplied Specification. The
        conceptual meaning of the call is:

        "I have this reference you gave me, and I would like to
        register a new entity to it with this Specification, to hold
        the supplied primary string. I trust that this is ok, and you
        will give me back the reference that represents the result of
        this."

        It is up to the manager to understand the correct result for the
        particular Specification in relation to this reference. For
        example, if you received this reference in response to browsing
        for a target to `kWriteMultiple` `ShotSpecification`s, then the
        Manager should have returned you a reference that you can then
        call register() on multiple times with a `ShotSpecification`
        without error. Each resulting entity reference should then
        reference the newly created Shot.

        @warning When registering files, it should never be assumed
        that the resulting @ref entity_reference will resolve to the
        same path. Managers may freely relocate, copy, move or rename
        files as part of registration.

        @param targetEntityRefs `List[str]` Entity references to publish.

        @param primaryStrings `List[str]` The @ref primary_string for
        each entity. It is the string the resulting @ref
        entity_reference will resolve to. In the case of file-based
        entities, this is the file path, and may be further modified
        by Managers that take care of relocating or managing the
        storage of files. The API defines that in the case of paths
        representing file sequences, frame tokens should be left
        un-substituted, in a sprintf compatible format, eg. "%04d",
        rather than say, the #### based method. If your application
        uses hashes, or some other scheme, it should be converted
        to/from the sprintf format as part of your integration.

        @param entitySpecs `List[`
            specifications.EntitySpecification `]`
        The `EntitySpecification` for each new registration.

        @param context Context The calling context.

        @param attributes `List[Union[Dict[str, primitive], None]`
        Optional attributes to set during publish.

        @return `List[Union[str,`
            exceptions.RegistrationError, exceptions.RetryableError `]]`
        The publish result for each corresponding entity. This is
        either an @ref entity_reference to the 'final' entity created
        by the publish action (which is not necessarily the same as
        the corresponding entry in `targetEntityRefs`); a
        `RegistrationError` if some fatal exception happens during
        publishing, indicating the process should be aborted; or
        `RetryableError` if any non-fatal error occurs that means you
        should retry the process later.

        @exception `IndexError` If `primaryStrings`, `targetEntityRefs`
        and `entitySpecs` are not lists of the same length.
