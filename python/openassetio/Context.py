  The Context object is used to convey information about the calling
  environment to a @ref Manager. It encapsulates several key access
  properties, as well as providing additional information about the @ref Host
  that may be useful to the @ref Manager to decorate or extend the metadata
  associated with the stored @ref Entity.

  A Manager will also use this information to ensure it presents the
  correct UI, or behaviour.

  The Context is passed to many calls in this API, and it may, or may not need
  to be used directly.

  @warning Contexts should never be directly constructed. Hosts should use
  @ref openassetio.hostAPI.Session.Session.createContext. A Manager implementation should never
  need to create a context of it's own, one will always be supplied through
  the ManagerInterface entry points.

    This is a concession to the fact that it's not always possible to fully

    @ref entity_reference that points to the newly published @ref Entity.
    This is often not the same as the reference that was passed to the call.
    The Host is expected to store this new reference for future use. For
    example in the case of a Scene File added to an 'open recent' menu. A
    Manager may rely on this to ensure a reference that points to a specific
    version is used in the future.
    In some cases - such as batch rendering of an image sequence, it may not be
    possible to store this final reference, due to constraints of the
    distributed natured of such a render. Often, it is not actually of
    consequence.
    To allow the @ref Manager to handle these situations correctly, Hosts are
    required to set this property to reflect their ability to persist this
