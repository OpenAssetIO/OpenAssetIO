    The Context object is used to convey information about the calling

    @ref host that may be useful to the @ref manager to decorate or
    extend the attributes associated with the stored @ref entity.

    A Manager will also use this information to ensure it presents the
    correct UI, or behavior.

    The Context is passed to many calls in this API, and it may, or may
    not need to be used directly.

    @warning Contexts should never be directly constructed. Hosts should
    use @ref openassetio.hostAPI.Session.Session.createContext. A
    Manager implementation should never need to create a context of it's
    own, one will always be supplied through the ManagerInterface entry

    ## points to the newly published @ref entity. This is often not the

    ## in the case of a Scene File added to an 'open recent' menu. A
    ## Manager may rely on this to ensure a reference that points to a
    ## specific version is used in the future.
    ##
    ## In some cases - such as batch rendering of an image sequence,
    ## it may not be possible to store this final reference, due to
    ## constraints of the distributed natured of such a render.
    ## Often, it is not actually of consequence. To allow the @ref manager
