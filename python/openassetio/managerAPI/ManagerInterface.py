class ManagerInterface(object):
    """
    @brief This Interface binds a @ref asset_management_system into
    OpenAssetIO. It is not called directly by a @ref host, but by the
    middle-ware that presents a more object-oriented model of this to
    the @ref host - namely, the @ref openassetio.hostAPI.Manager.

    It is structured around the following principals:

      @li The currency of the API is either data, or an @ref
      entity_reference. objects should not be used to represent an @ref
      entity or its properties.

      @li The manager plugin is expected to be batch-first. That is,
      where relevant, methods expect lists as their primary input
      parameters, and return a list as the result. This means a host
      can batch together multiple items and execute the same command
      on every item in the list in a single call, saving on
      potentially expensive round-trips and allowing the manager to
      use other back-end optimisations.

      @li The interface is stateless as far as the host-facing API is
      concerned. The result of any method should solely depend on its
      inputs. This class could be static. In practice though, in a
      real-world session with a host, there are benefits to having an
      'instance' with a managed lifetime. This can be used to facilitate
      caching etc.

      @li The implementation of this class should have no UI
      dependencies, so that it can be used in command-line only
      hosts/batch process etc...

      @li You generally don't need to call the superclass implementation
      of any methods in this interface, unless you are deriving from your
      own subclass which requires it.

    Logging and Error Handling
    --------------------------

    The supplied @ref openassetio.managerAPI.HostSession.HostSession
    "HostSession" object provides logging methods that allow messages
    and progress to be reported back to the user. All logging should go
    through these methods otherwise it may not be correctly presented to
    the user. The loose term "user" also covers developers, who may need
    to see log output for debugging and other purposes.

    @warning Your plugin may be hosted out of process, or even on
    another machine, the HostSession bridge takes care of relaying
    messages accordingly. Using custom logging mechanisms may well
    result in output being lost.

    @see @ref openassetio.managerAPI.HostSession.HostSession.log "HostSession.log"
    @see @ref openassetio.managerAPI.HostSession.HostSession.progress "HostSession.progress"

    Exceptions should be thrown to handle any in-flight errors that
    occur.  The error should be mapped to a derived class of
    exceptions.OpenAssetIOException, and thrown.  All exceptions of this
    kind, will be correctly passed across the plug-in C boundary,
    and re-thrown. Other exceptions should not be used.

     @see @ref openassetio.exceptions "exceptions"

    Threading
    ---------
    Any implementation of the ManagerInterface should be thread safe.
    The one exception being Manager::initialize, this will never be
    called concurrently.

    When a @ref openassetio.Context object is constructed by @ref
    openassetio.hostAPI.Session.Session.createContext, the @ref
    createState method will be called, and the resulting state object
    stored in the context. This context will then be re-used across
    related API calls to your implementation of the ManagerInterface.
    You can use this to determine which calls may be part of a specific
    'action' in the same host, or logically grouped processes such as a
    batch render. This should allow you to implement stable resolution
    of @ref meta_version "meta-versions" or other resolve-time concepts.

    One exception to the treading rule is that the transaction managing
    functions won't be called from multiple threads with the same
    transaction object.

    There should be no persistent state in the implementation, concepts
    such as getError(), etc.. for example should not be used.

    Hosts
    -----

    Sometimes you may need to know more information about the API host.
    A @ref openassetio.managerAPI.Host object is available through the
    @ref openassetio.managerAPI.HostSession object passed to each method
    of this class. This provides a standardised interface that all API
    hosts guarantee to implement. This can be used to identify exactly
    which host you are being called for, and query various entity
    related specifics of the hosts data model.

    @see @ref openassetio.managerAPI.Host "Host"

    Initialization
    --------------

    The constructor makes a new instance, but at this point it is not
    ready for use. Instances of this class should be light weight to
    create, but don't have to be lightweight to initialize. The
    informational methods must be available pre-initialization, so that
    UI and other display-type queries can be made relatively cheaply to
    provide users with a list of managers and their settings. None of
    the entity-related methods will be called until after @ref
    initialize has been called. The following methods must be callable
    prior to initialization:

       @li @ref identifier()
       @li @ref displayName()
       @li @ref info()
       @li @ref updateTerminology()

    #  @li In 3D CGI, Multiple AOVs or layers may be related to a 'beauty' render.
    #  @li In Compositing, an image sequence may be related to the script
    #  that created it.
    #  @li An asset may be related to a task that specifies work to be done.
    #  @li Parent/child relationships are also (semantically) covered by
    #  these relationships.
    #
    # In the this API, these relationships are represented by a generic
    # Specification, this may just be a 'type', but can additionally have
    # arbitrary attributes to further define the relationship. For example in
    # the case of AOVs, the type might be 'alternate output' and the
    # attributes may be that the 'channel' is 'diffuse'.
    #
    # Related references form a vital part in the abstraction of the internal
    # structure of the asset management system from the Host application in its
    # attempts to provide the user with meaningful functionality. A good example
    # of this is in an editorial example, where it may need to query whether a
    # 'shot' exists in a certain part of the asset system. One approach would be
    # to use a 'getChildren' call, on this part of the system. This has the
    # drawback that is assumes that shots are always something that can be
    # described as 'immediate children' of the location in question. This lay not
    # always be the case (say, for example there is some kind of 'task' structure
    # in place too). Instead we use a request that asks for any 'shots' that
    # relate to the chosen location. It is then up to the implementation of the
    # ManagerInterface to determine how that maps to its own data model.
    # Hopefully this allows Hosts of this API to work with a broader range of
    # asset managements, without providing any requirements of their structure or

    # @name Publishing
    #
    # The publishing functions allow a host create entities within the
    # @ref asset_management_system represented by this implementation. The API
    # is designed to accommodate the broad variety of roles that
    # different asset managers embody. Some are 'librarians' that simply
    # catalog the locations of existing media. Others take an active role
    # in both the temporary and long-term paths to items they manage.
    #
    # There are two key components to publishing within this API.
    #
    # **1 - The Entity Reference**
    #
    # As with the other entry points in this API, it is assumed that an @ref
    # entity_reference is known ahead of time. How this reference is determined
    # is beyond the scope of this layer of the API, and functions exists in
    # higher levels that combine browsing and publishing etc... Here, we simply
    # assert that there must be a meaningful reference given the @ref
    # Specification of the entity that is being created or published.
    #
    # @note 'Meaningful' is best defined by the asset manager itself. For
    # example, in a system that versions each 'asset' by creating children of the
    # asset for each version, when talking about where to publish an image
    # sequence of a render to, it may make sense to reference to the Asset
    # itself, so that the system can determine the 'next' version number at the
    # time of publish. It may also make sense to reference a specific version of
    # this asset to implicitly state which version it will be written to. Other
    # entity types may not have this flexibility.
    #
    # **2 - The Specification**
    #
    # The Specification allows ancillary information to be provided to help the
    # implementation better interpret what type of entity may be best suited in
    # any given situation. For example, a path to an image will generally be
    # accompanied by with an spec, that details the file type, color space,
    # resolution etc...
    #

        checking, placeholder creation or any other sundry preparatory
        actions to be carried out.

        Generally, this will be called before register() in any host
        that creates media, where the return to @ref managementPolicy
        has the constants.kWillManagePath bit set.

        @param targetEntityRefs `List[str]` An @ref entity_reference
        for each entity that it is desired to publish the forthcoming
        data to. See the notes in the API documentation for the
        specifics of this.

        @param entitySpecs `List[`
            specifications.EntitySpecification `]`
        A description of each entity that is being published.

        @param context Context The calling context. This is not
        replaced with an array in order to simplify implementation.
        Otherwise, transactional handling has the potential to be
        extremely complex if different contexts are allowed.

        @param hostSession HostSession The API session.

        @return `List[Union[str,`
            exceptions.PreflightError, exceptions.RetryableError `]]`
        The preflight result for each corresponding entity. If
        successful, this should be an @ref entity_reference that the
        host should resolve to determine the path to write media to.
        This may or may not be the same as the input reference. A host
        will resolve this reference to get the working URL before
        writing any files or other data. If preflight was
        unsuccessful, the result for an entity should be either a
        `PreflightError` if some fatal exception happens during
        preflight, indicating the process should be aborted; or
        `RetryableError` if any non-fatal error occurs that means the

        Publish entities to the @ref asset_management_system.

        This instructs the implementation to ensure a valid entity
        exists for each given reference and spec. This will be called
        either in isolation or after calling preflight, depending on the
        nature of the data being published and the `kWillManagePath` bit
        of the returned @ref managementPolicy.

        This is an opportunity to do other things in the host as part of
        publishing if required. The context's locale will tell you more
        about the specifics of the calling application. Depending on the
        implementation of your plugin, you can use this opportunity to
        make use of the host-native SDK to extract additional
        information or schedule additional processes to produce
        derivative data.

        @param primaryStrings `List[str]` The @ref primary_string that
        each entity should resolve to if passed to a call to
        resolveEntityReference(). This may be left blank if there is
        no meaningful string representation of that entity (eg: a
        'sequence' in a hierarchy). This must be stored by the
        manager and a logically equivalent value returned by @ref
        resolveEntityReference for the same reference. The meaning of
        'logical' here, in the case of a URL, is that it points to
        the same data. The manager is free to relocate data as
        required. If a primary string is not a URL, then it should be
        returned verbatim.

        @param targetEntityRefs `List[str]` The @ref entity_reference
        of each entity to publish. It is up to the manager to ensure
        that this is meaningful, as it is most likely implementation
        specific. For example, if a 'Shot' specification is requested
        to be published to a reference that points to a 'Sequence' it
        makes sense to interpret this as a 'add a shot of this spec
        to the sequence'. For other types of entity, there may be
        different constraints on what makes sense.

        @param entitySpecs `List[`
            specifications.EntitySpecification `]`
        A description of each entity (or 'asset') that is being
        published. It is *not* required for the implementation to
        store any information contained in the specification, though
        it may choose to use it if it is meaningful. The host will
        separately call setEntityAttributes() if it wishes to persist
        any other information in an entity.

        @param context Context The calling context. This is not
        replaced with an array in order to simplify implementation.
        Otherwise, transactional handling has the potential to be
        extremely complex if different contexts are allowed.

        @param hostSession HostSession The API session.

        @return `List[Union[str,`
            exceptions.RegistrationError, exceptions.RetryableError `]]`
        The publish result for each corresponding entity. This is
        either an @ref entity_reference to the 'final' entity created
        by the publish action (which does not need to be the same as
        the corresponding entry in `targetEntityRefs`); a
        `RegistrationError` if some fatal exception happens during
        publishing, indicating the process should be aborted; or
        `RetryableError` if any non-fatal error occurs that means the
        host should retry from the beginning of any given process.

        from this function.

        This method is called whenever a new @ref Context is made by a
        @ref openassetio.hostAPI.Session.Session.createContext. The return is

        to anchor the api call to a particular snapshot of the state of
        the asset inventory.

        may be used when creating a child Context for persistence
        somewhere in a UI, etc... when further processing may change the
        access/retention of the Context. It is expected that the manager
