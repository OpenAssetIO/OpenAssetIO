    The HostSession is a manager-facing class that represents a discreet
    API session started by a @ref host in order to communicate with a
    manager.

    Any generalised API interactions a Manager may wish to make with a
    Host should be performed through the HostSession instance supplied
    with any ManagerInterface entrypoint. These objects should not be
    directly constructed, cached or otherwise persisted by a Manager.

    The HostSession provides access to:
      - A concrete instance of the @ref
        openassetio.hostAPI.HostInterface, implemented by the tool or
        application that initiated the API session.
      - A logging callback. All user-facing messaging should be directed
        through this entrypoint. This ensures it will be appropriately
        presented to the user.
