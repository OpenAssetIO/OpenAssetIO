    The Host object represents the tool or application that created a session with OAIO,
    and wants to query or store information within a @ref manager.

    The Host provides a generalised API to query the identity of the caller
    of the API, as well as which entities are used within the current document.

    Hosts should never be directly constructed by the Manager's implementation.
    Instead, the @ref HostSession class provided to all manager API entry points
    provides access to the current host through the @ref HostSession.host() method.
