  /**
   * Management Policy queries allow a host to ask a Manager how they
   * would like to interact with different kinds of entity, and which
   * traits they are capable of resolving (or persisting). This allows
   * you to adapt application logic or user-facing behaviour
   * accordingly.
   *
   * Queries return a @fqref{TraitsData} "TraitsData" for each supplied
   * @ref trait_set, imbued with traits that describe the manager's
   * policy for entities with those traits, and which traits they are
   * capable of resolving/storing data for.
   *
   * This is an opt-in mechanism, such that if result is empty, then
   * the manager does not handle entities with the supplied traits.
   * In this situation, OpenAssetIO based functionality should be
   * disabled in the host when processing data of that type, and
   * traditional mechanisms used instead.
   *
   * This is particularly relevant for data types that may generate
   * large volumes of API requests, that can be avoided if the data in
   * question is not managed by the manager, or it can't resolve a
   * required trait.
   *
   * When querying this API, each Trait Set should be composed of:
   *
   *  - The trait set of the entity type in question. This is usually
   *    obtained from the relevant @ref Specification.
   *  - For read contexts, any additional traits with properties that
   *    you wish to resolve for that type of entity.
   *  - For write contexts, any additional traits with properties that
   *    you wish to publish for that type of entity.
   *
   * Along with the traits that describe the manager's desired
   * interaction pattern (ones with the `managementPolicy` usage
   * metadata), the resulting @fqref{TraitsData} "TraitsData" will be imbued with
   * (potentially a subset of) the requested traits, which the manager is
   * capable of resolving/persisting the properties for.
   *
   * If a requested trait is not present, then the manager will never
   * return properties for that trait in @ref resolve, or be able to
   * persist those properties with @ref register. This allows you to
   * know in advance if you can expect the configured manager to be able
   * to provide data you may require.
   *
   * @note Because traits are specific to any given application of the
   * API, please refer to the documentation for any relevant companion
   * project(s) that provide traits and specifications for your specific
   * scenario. For example, the
   * <a href="https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation"
   * target="_blank">OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation</a> project provides
   * traits for common data types used in computer graphics and media
   * production. Use the concrete Trait/Specification classes provided
   * by these projects to retrieve data from the supplied TraitsData
   * instead of querying directly using string literals.
   *
   * @warning The @fqref{Context.access} "access" of the supplied
   * context will be considered by the manager. If it is set to read,
   * then its response applies to resolution. If write, then it applies
   * to publishing. Managers may not handle both operations in the same
   * way. In most situations you will need to make separate queries for
   * read and write and adapt your business logic accordingly.
   *
   * @note There is no requirement to call this method before any other
   * API interaction, though it is strongly recommended to do so where
   * such information enables high-level behavioural changes or
   * optimisations that improve user experience.

  /**
   * @name Publishing
   *
   * The publishing functions allow the host to create an @ref entity
   * within the @ref asset_management_system represented by the Manager.
   * The API is designed to accommodate the broad variety of roles that
   * different asset managers embody. Some are 'librarians' that simply
   * catalog the locations of existing media. Others take an active role
   * in both the temporary and long-term paths to items they manage.
   *
   * There are two key components to publishing within this API.
   *
   * *1 - The Entity Reference*
   *
   * As with the other entry points in this API, it is assumed that an
   * @ref entity_reference is known ahead of time. How this reference is
   * determined is beyond the scope of this layer of the API, and
   * functions exists in higher levels that combine browsing and
   * publishing etc... Here, we simply assert that there must be a
   * meaningful reference given the @fqref{TraitsData} "TraitsData" of
   * the entity that is being created or published.
   *
   * @note 'Meaningful' is best defined by the asset manager itself. For
   * example, in a system that versions each 'asset' by creating
   * children of the asset for each version, when talking about where to
   * publish an image sequence of a render to, it may make sense to
   * reference to the Asset itself, so that the system can determine the
   * 'next' version number at the time of publish. It may also make
   * sense to reference a specific version of this asset to implicitly
   * state which version it will be written to. Other entity types may
   * not have this flexibility.
   *
   * **2 - TraitsData**
   *
   * The data for an entity is defined by one or more @ref trait
   * "traits" and their properties. The resulting @ref trait_set defines
   * the "type" of the entity, and the trait property values hold the
   * data for each specific entity.
   *
   * This means that OpenAssetIO it not just limited to working with
   * file-based data. Traits allow ancillary information to be managed
   * (such as the colorspace for an image), as well as container-like
   * entities such as shots/sequences/etc..
   *
   * For more on the relationship between Entities, Specifications and
   * traits, please see @ref entities_traits_and_specifications "this"
   * page.
   *
   * The action of 'publishing' itself, is split into two parts, depending on
   * the nature of the item to be published.
   *
   *  @li **Preflight** When you are about to create some new
   *  media/asset.
   *  @li **Registration** When you wish to publish media
   *  that exists.
   *
   * For examples of how to correctly call these parts of the API, see
   * the @ref examples page.
   *
   * @note The term '@ref publish' is somewhat loaded. It generally
   * means something different depending on who you are talking to. See
   * the @ref publish "Glossary entry" for more on this, but to help
   * avoid confusion, this API provides the @needsref updateTerminology
   * call, in order to allow the Manager to standardize some of the
   * language and terminology used in your presentation of the asset
   * management system with other integrations of the system.
   *
   * *3 - Thumbnails*
   *
   * The API provides a mechanism for a manager to request a thumbnail
   * for an entity as it is being published, see: @ref thumbnails.
   *

   * "managementPolicy" for the traits of the entities you are intending
   * to register. Otherwise, the Manager is saying it doesn't handle
   * entities with those traits, and it should not be registered.
   *
   * @warning The list of supported traits a manager returns in its @ref
   * managementPolicy response may be a subset of the trait set you
   * requested. This means that when data is registered, only property
   * values for those specific traits will be persisted, the rest will
   * be ignored. The full @ref trait_set will always be stored though,
   * to facilitate future identification.
   *
   * As each @ref entity_reference has (ultimately) come from the
   * manager (either in response to delegation of UI/etc... or as a
   * return from another call), then it can be assumed that the
   * Manager will understand what it means for you to call `register`
   * on this reference with the supplied @fqref{TraitsData}

   * particular trait set in relation to this reference. For example,
   * if you received this reference in response to browsing for a
   * target to `kWriteMultiple` and the traits of a
   * `ShotSpecification`s, then the Manager should have returned you

   * entity reference should then reference the newly created Shot.

   * @note All supplied TraitsDatas should have the same trait
   * sets. If you wish to register different "types" of entity, they
   * need to be registered in separate calls.
   *
   * @warning When registering traits that contain URLs or file paths
   * (for example the MediaCreation LocatableContent trait), it should
   * never be assumed that the resulting @ref entity_reference will
   * resolve to the same path. Managers may freely relocate, copy, move
   * or rename data as part of registration. Data for other trait
   * properties may also change if the entity has been otherwise
   * modified by some other interaction with the manager.
   *
