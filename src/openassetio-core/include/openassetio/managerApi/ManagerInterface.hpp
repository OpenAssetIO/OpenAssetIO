OPENASSETIO_DECLARE_PTR(ManagerInterface)

/**
 * This Interface binds a @ref asset_management_system into
 * OpenAssetIO. It is not called directly by a @ref host, but by the
 * middleware that presents a more object-oriented model of this to
 * the @ref host - namely, the @ref openassetio.hostApi.Manager.
 *
 * It is structured around the following principles:
 *
 *   @li The currency of the API is either data, or an @ref
 *   entity_reference. objects should not be used to represent an @ref
 *   entity or its properties.
 *
 *   @li The manager plugin is expected to be batch-first. That is,
 *   where relevant, methods expect lists as their primary input
 *   parameters, and return a list as the result. This means a host
 *   can batch together multiple items and execute the same command
 *   on every item in the list in a single call, saving on
 *   potentially expensive round-trips and allowing the manager to
 *   use other back-end optimisations.
 *
 *   @li The interface is stateless as far as the host-facing API is
 *   concerned. The result of any method should solely depend on its
 *   inputs. This class could be static. In practice though, in a
 *   real-world session with a host, there are benefits to having an
 *   'instance' with a managed lifetime. This can be used to facilitate
 *   caching etc.
 *
 *   @li The implementation of this class should have no UI
 *   dependencies, so that it can be used in command-line only
 *   hosts/batch process etc...
 *
 *   @li You generally don't need to call the superclass implementation
 *   of any methods in this interface, unless you are deriving from your
 *   own subclass which requires it.
 *
 * Logging and Error Handling
 * --------------------------
 *
 * The supplied @fqref{managerApi.HostSession} "HostSession" object
 * provides access to a logger that allow messages and progress to be
 * reported back to the user. All logging should go through these
 * methods otherwise it may not be correctly presented to the user. The
 * loose term "user" also covers developers, who may need to see log
 * output for debugging and other purposes.
 *
 * @warning Your plugin may be hosted out of process, or even on
 * another machine, the HostSession bridge takes care of relaying
 * messages accordingly. Using custom logging mechanisms may well
 * result in output being lost.
 *
 * @see @fqref{managerApi.HostSession.logger} "HostSession.logger"
 * @see @fqref{log.LoggerInterface} "LoggerInterface"
 *
 * Exceptions should be thrown to handle any in-flight errors that
 * occur. The error should be mapped to a derived class of
 * exceptions.OpenAssetIOException, and thrown.  All exceptions of this
 * kind will be correctly passed across the plug-in C boundary,
 * and re-thrown. Other exceptions should not be used.
 *
 *  @see @ref openassetio.exceptions "exceptions"
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 * Any implementation of the ManagerInterface should be thread safe.
 * The one exception being @ref initialize, this will never be
 * called concurrently.
 *
 * When a @fqref{Context} "Context" object is constructed by
 * @fqref{hostApi.Manager.createContext} "createContext", the @ref
 * createState (or @ref createChildState for
 * @fqref{hostApi.Manager.createChildContext} "createChildContext")
 * method will be called, and the resulting state object stored in the
 * context. This context will then be re-used across related API calls
 * to your implementation of the ManagerInterface. You can use this to
 * determine which calls may be part of a specific 'action' in the same
 * host, or logically grouped processes such as a batch render. This
 * should allow you to implement stable resolution of @ref meta_version
 * "meta-versions" or other resolve-time concepts.
 *
 * There should be no persistent state in the implementation, concepts
 * such as getError(), etc.. for example should not be used.
 *
 * Hosts
 * -----
 *
 * Sometimes you may need to know more information about the API host.
 * A @ref openassetio.managerApi.Host object is available through the
 * @ref openassetio.managerApi.HostSession object passed to each method
 * of this class. This provides a standardised interface that all API
 * hosts guarantee to implement. This can be used to identify exactly
 * which host you are being called for, and query various entity
 * related specifics of the hosts data model.
 *
 * @see @ref openassetio.managerApi.Host "Host"
 *
 * Initialization
 * --------------
 *
 * The constructor makes a new instance, but at this point it is not
 * ready for use. Instances of this class should be light weight to
 * create, but don't have to be lightweight to initialize. The
 * informational methods must be available pre-initialization, so that
 * UI and other display-type queries can be made relatively cheaply to
 * provide users with a list of managers and their settings. None of
 * the entity-related methods will be called until after @ref
 * initialize has been called. The following methods must be callable
 * prior to initialization:
 *
 *    @li @ref identifier()
 *    @li @ref displayName()
 *    @li @ref info()
 *    @li @needsref updateTerminology()
 *    @li @ref settings()
 *
 * @todo Finish/Document settings mechanism.
 * @see @ref initialize
 *
 * @note OpenAssetIO makes use of shared pointers to facilitate object
 * lifetime management across multiple languages. Instances passed into
 * API methods via shared pointer may have their lifetimes extended
 * beyond that of your code.

   * This method is usually called early on by a host to determine

   * the API or presenting asset-centric elements of a workflow to the

  /**
   * @name Publishing
   *
   * The publishing functions allow a host create entities within the
   * @ref asset_management_system represented by this implementation.
   * The API is designed to accommodate the broad variety of roles that
   * different asset managers embody. Some are 'librarians' that simply
   * catalog the locations of existing media. Others take an active role
   * in both the temporary and long-term paths to items they manage.
   *
   * There are two key components to publishing within this API.
   *
   * **1 - The Entity Reference**
   *
   * As with the other entry points in this API, it is assumed that an
   * @ref entity_reference is known ahead of time. How this reference is
   * determined is beyond the scope of this layer of the API, and
   * functions exists in higher levels that combine browsing and
   * publishing etc... Here, we simply assert that there must be a
   * meaningful reference given the @ref trait_set of the entity that is
   * being created or published.
   *
   * @note 'Meaningful' is best defined by the asset manager itself. For
   * example, in a system that versions each 'asset' by creating
   * children of the asset for each version, when talking about where to
   * publish an image sequence of a render to, it may make sense to
   * reference to the Asset itself, so that the system can determine the
   * 'next' version number at the time of publish. It may also make
   * sense to reference a specific version of this asset to implicitly
   * state which version it will be written to. Other entity types may
   * not have this flexibility.
   *
   * **2 - TraitsData**
   *
   * The data for an entity is defined by one or more @ref trait
   * "Traits" and their properties. The resulting @ref trait_set
   * defines the "type" of the entity, and the trait property values
   * hold the data for each specific entity.
   *
   * This means that OpenAssetIO it not just limited to working with
   * file-based data. Traits allow ancillary information to be managed
   * (such as the colorspace for an image), as well as container-like
   * entities such as shots/sequences/etc.
   *
   * For more on the relationship between Entities, Specifications and
   * traits, please see @ref entities_traits_and_specifications
   * "this" page.
   *
   * The action of 'publishing' itself, is split into two parts,
   * depending on the nature of the item to be published.
   *
   *  @li **Preflight** When a Host is about to create some new
   *  media/asset.
   *  @li **Registration** When a Host is ready to publish
   *  media that exists.
   *
   * For examples of how to correctly call these parts of the
   * API within a host, see the @ref examples page.
   *
   * @note The term '@ref publish' is somewhat loaded. It generally
   * means something different depending on who you are talking to. See
   * the @ref publish "Glossary entry" for more on this, but to help
   * avoid confusion, this API provides the @needsref updateTerminology
   * call, in order to allow the implementation to standardize some of
   * the language and terminology used in a Hosts presentation of the
   * asset management system with other integrations of the system.

   * referenced entity. The entity may not yet exist (@ref
   * entity_reference). This call is designed to allow validation of
   * the target reference, placeholder creation or any other sundry
   * preparatory actions to be carried out.
   *
   * If this does not apply to the manager's workflow, then the
   * method can pass back the input reference once the target entity
   *   reference has been validated.
   *
   * Generally, this will be called before register() when data is not
   * already immediately available for registration, to allow
   * placeholder actions to be performed. Note: depending on the
   * returned @fqref{managerApi.ManagerInterface.managementPolicy}
   * "managementPolicy", the host may make additional API queries using
   * the reference returned here before registration.
   *
   * This call must block until preflight is complete for all
   * supplied references, and callbacks have been called on the same
   * thread that called `preflight`
   *
   * @warning If the supplied @ref trait_set is missing required traits
   * for any of the provided references (maybe they are mismatched with
   * the target entity, or missing essential data) then error that
   * element with an appropriate @fqref{BatchElementError.ErrorCode}.
   *
   * @param entityReferences An @ref entity_reference for each entity
   * that it is desired to publish the forthcoming data to. See the
   * notes in the API documentation for the specifics of this.
   *
   * @param traitSet The @ref trait_set of the entities that are being
   * published.
   *
   * @param context The calling context. This is not replaced with an
   * array in order to simplify implementation. Otherwise, transactional
   * handling has the potential to be extremely complex if different
   * contexts are allowed.
   *
   * @param hostSession The API session.
   *
   * @param successCallback Callback to be called for each successful
   * preflight of an entity reference. It should be called with the
   * corresponding index of the entity reference in @p entityReferences
   * along with the (potentially revised) working reference to be
   * used by the host for the rest of the publishing operation for
   * this specific entity (ie, resolve then register). This is an
   * opportunity to update the reference to one specific to any
   * placeholder/reserved entities if applicable. The callback must
   * be called on the same thread that initiated the call to
   * `preflight`.
   *
   * @param errorCallback Callback to be called for each failed
   * preflight of an entity reference. It should be called with the
   * corresponding index of the entity reference in @p entityReferences
   * along with a populated @fqref{BatchElementError}
   * "BatchElementError" (see @fqref{BatchElementError.ErrorCode}
   * "ErrorCodes"). The callback must be called on the same thread that
   * initiated the call to `preflight`. A
   * @fqref{BatchElementError.ErrorCode.kEntityAccessError}
   * "kEntityAccessError" should be used for any target references that

   * This instructs the implementation to ensure a valid entity exists
   * for each given reference and to persist the data provided in the

   * after calling preflight, depending on whether work needed to be
   * done to generate the data. Preflight is omitted if the data is already
   * available at the time of publishing.
   *
   * This call must block until registration is complete for all
   * supplied references, and callbacks have been called on the same
   * thread that called `register`
   *
   * This is an opportunity to do other things in the host as part of

   * about the specifics of the calling application. Depending on the
   * implementation of your plugin, you can use this opportunity to
   * make use of the host-native SDK to extract additional
   * information or schedule additional processes to produce
   * derivative data.
   *
   * @warning It is a requirement of the API that the @ref trait_set of
   * the supplied TraitsData for each reference is persisted. This forms
   * the entity's 'type'. It is also a requirement that the properties
   * of any traits indicated as supported by your response to a
   * `managementPolicy` query for write context are persisted.
   *
   * If the supplied @ref trait_set is missing required traits for any
   * of the provided references (maybe they are mismatched with the
   * target entity, or missing essential data) then error that
   * element with an appropriate @fqref{BatchElementError.ErrorCode} "ErrorCode".
   *
   * @param entityReferences  The @ref entity_reference of each entity
   * to register_. It is up to the manager to ensure that this is
   * meaningful, as it is most likely implementation specific. For
   * example, if an entity with the traits of a 'Shot' specification is
   * requested to be published to a reference that points to a
   * 'Sequence' it makes sense to interpret this as a 'add a shot of
   * this spec to the sequence'. For other types of entity, there may be
   * different constraints on what makes sense.
   *
   * @param entityTraitsDatas The data for each entity (or 'asset') that
   * is being published. The implementation must persist the list of
   * traits, and any supported traits with properties. Such that a
   * subsequent call to @ref resolve for any of these traits contains
   * that data. It is guaranteed that the trait sets of these
   * instances are constant across the batch.
   *
   * @note Generally speaking, the data within the supplied
   * trait properties should be persisted verbatim. If however, the
   * implementation has any specific understanding of any given
   * trait, it is free to rewrite this data in any meaningful
   * fashion. The simplest example of this is the MediaCreation
   * `LocatableContent` trait, where the location URL may be updated to
   * the long-term persistent storage location of the registered data,
   * after it has been re-located by the manager.
   *
   * @param context The calling context. This is not
   * replaced with an array in order to simplify implementation.
   * Otherwise, transactional handling has the potential to be
   * extremely complex if different contexts are allowed.
   *
   * @param hostSession The API session.
   *
   * @param successCallback Callback to be called for each successful
   * registration. It should be called with the corresponding index
   * of the entity reference in @p entityReferences along with the
   * (potentially revised) final reference to be used by the host for
   * subsequent interactions with this specific entity. This is an
   * opportunity to update the reference to one specific to the
   * resulting entity and/or its specific version as applicable. The
   * callback must be called on the same thread that initiated the
   * call to `register`.
   *
   * @param errorCallback Callback to be called for each failed
   * registration. It should be called with the corresponding index
   * of the entity reference in @p entityReferences along with a
   * populated @fqref{BatchElementError} "BatchElementError" (see
