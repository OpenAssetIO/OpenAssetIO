OPENASSETIO_DECLARE_PTR(ManagerInterface)

/**
 * This Interface binds a @ref asset_management_system into
 * OpenAssetIO. It is not called directly by a @ref host, but by the
 * middleware that presents a more object-oriented model of this to
 * the @ref host - namely, the @ref openassetio.hostApi.Manager.
 *
 * It is structured around the following principles:
 *
 *   @li The currency of the API is either data, or an @ref
 *   entity_reference. objects should not be used to represent an @ref
 *   entity or its properties.
 *
 *   @li The manager plugin is expected to be batch-first. That is,
 *   where relevant, methods expect lists as their primary input
 *   parameters, and return a list as the result. This means a host
 *   can batch together multiple items and execute the same command
 *   on every item in the list in a single call, saving on
 *   potentially expensive round-trips and allowing the manager to
 *   use other back-end optimisations.
 *
 *   @li The interface is stateless as far as the host-facing API is
 *   concerned. The result of any method should solely depend on its
 *   inputs. This class could be static. In practice though, in a
 *   real-world session with a host, there are benefits to having an
 *   'instance' with a managed lifetime. This can be used to facilitate
 *   caching etc.
 *
 *   @li The implementation of this class should have no UI
 *   dependencies, so that it can be used in command-line only
 *   hosts/batch process etc...
 *
 *   @li You generally don't need to call the superclass implementation
 *   of any methods in this interface, unless you are deriving from your
 *   own subclass which requires it.
 *
 * Logging and Error Handling
 * --------------------------
 *
 * The supplied @fqref{managerApi.HostSession} "HostSession" object
 * provides access to a logger that allow messages and progress to be
 * reported back to the user. All logging should go through these
 * methods otherwise it may not be correctly presented to the user. The
 * loose term "user" also covers developers, who may need to see log
 * output for debugging and other purposes.
 *
 * @warning Your plugin may be hosted out of process, or even on
 * another machine, the HostSession bridge takes care of relaying
 * messages accordingly. Using custom logging mechanisms may well
 * result in output being lost.
 *
 * @see @fqref{managerApi.HostSession.logger} "HostSession.logger"
 * @see @fqref{log.LoggerInterface} "LoggerInterface"
 *
 * Exceptions should be thrown to handle any in-flight errors that
 * occur. The error should be mapped to a derived class of
 * exceptions.OpenAssetIOException, and thrown.  All exceptions of this
 * kind will be correctly passed across the plug-in C boundary,
 * and re-thrown. Other exceptions should not be used.
 *
 *  @see @ref openassetio.exceptions "exceptions"
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 * Any implementation of the ManagerInterface should be thread safe.
 * The one exception being @ref initialize, this will never be
 * called concurrently.
 *
 * When a @fqref{Context} "Context" object is constructed by
 * @fqref{hostApi.Manager.createContext} "createContext", the @ref
 * createState (or @ref createChildState for
 * @fqref{hostApi.Manager.createChildContext} "createChildContext")
 * method will be called, and the resulting state object stored in the
 * context. This context will then be re-used across related API calls
 * to your implementation of the ManagerInterface. You can use this to
 * determine which calls may be part of a specific 'action' in the same
 * host, or logically grouped processes such as a batch render. This
 * should allow you to implement stable resolution of @ref meta_version
 * "meta-versions" or other resolve-time concepts.
 *
 * There should be no persistent state in the implementation, concepts
 * such as getError(), etc.. for example should not be used.
 *
 * Hosts
 * -----
 *
 * Sometimes you may need to know more information about the API host.
 * A @ref openassetio.managerApi.Host object is available through the
 * @ref openassetio.managerApi.HostSession object passed to each method
 * of this class. This provides a standardised interface that all API
 * hosts guarantee to implement. This can be used to identify exactly
 * which host you are being called for, and query various entity
 * related specifics of the hosts data model.
 *
 * @see @ref openassetio.managerApi.Host "Host"
 *
 * Initialization
 * --------------
 *
 * The constructor makes a new instance, but at this point it is not
 * ready for use. Instances of this class should be light weight to
 * create, but don't have to be lightweight to initialize. The
 * informational methods must be available pre-initialization, so that
 * UI and other display-type queries can be made relatively cheaply to
 * provide users with a list of managers and their settings. None of
 * the entity-related methods will be called until after @ref
 * initialize has been called. The following methods must be callable
 * prior to initialization:
 *
 *    @li @ref identifier()
 *    @li @ref displayName()
 *    @li @ref info()
 *    @li @needsref updateTerminology()
 *    @li @ref settings()
 *
 * @todo Finish/Document settings mechanism.
 * @see @ref initialize

   * destination to save to.
   *
   * This information is then used to determine which options should
   * be presented to the user or which workflows may be performed by

   * located. In many cases, this greatly reduces the sophistication
   * of the integration as registering the asset becomes a partially
   * manual task, rather than one that can be fully automated for new
   * assets.
   *
   * For read contexts, the @ref traits.managementPolicy.ManagedTrait
   * "ManagedTrait" should only be imbued in the returned

   * For write contexts, the @ref traits.managementPolicy.ManagedTrait
   * "ManagedTrait" should only be imbued if the manager is capable
   * of persisting all traits (and any of their property data) when
   * they are registered for an entity, and returning that data via
