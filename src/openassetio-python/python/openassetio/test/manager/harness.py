@namespace openassetio.test.manager.harness
A `unittest` based test harness that allows @ref manager plugin
developers to check that their implementation meets the requirements of
the API.

The harness can be invoked programatically or via tha CLI. The module
exposes the main test entry point and fixture loading methods. This
permits additional test suites to be written and run by the developer,
to test manager-specific functionality if desired.
