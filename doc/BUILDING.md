## System requirements

We assume the following system packages are installed

- CMake 3.21+
- C++17 or later compliant compiler
(GCC 9.3+ / MSVC 16.9+ / macOS 10.15+)

For linting and other build verification options, we assume the
following packages are installed:

- LLVM 12.0.0

## Library dependencies

### Build dependencies

Binary builds additionally require the following packages to be
available.

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/) (development install)
- [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 2.8.1+
- [toml++](https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/) 3.2.0+

### Test dependencies

Building and running tests requires the following additional packages:

- [catch2](https://catch2.docsforge.com/) 2.13
- [trompeloeil](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil) 42

We use the CMake build system for compiling the C++ core library and
its Python bindings. As such, a library being available means that it
must be discoverable by CMake's [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html).

During development, we tend use [ConanCenter](https://conan.io/center/)
to fulfill the [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) requirement.
See [Building](#building) for more information.

> **Warning**
>
> If attempting to build on CentOS 7 using the ConanCenter
> Python 3.7 package you will likely hit an [issue installing pkgconf](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues/8541).

> **Warning**
>
> On macOS, by default, CMake prefers Framework installations
> (see: [$CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK.html)).
> This means dependencies such as Python may default to the system
> installation despite alternatives being present. In addition, if you
> are attempting to use the ConanCenter cpython package as an
> alternative, we have encountered missing header issues that may
> require additional work/configuration to resolve.

## Building

OpenAssetIO consists of a core C++ project, as well as a set of C and
Python bindings to that core library. These modules are organized into a
CMake project, and are all built together by default.

Assuming your build environment has the required dependencies,
[(see above)](#build-dependencies), OpenAssetIO can be built and installed by
running:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

> **Note**
>
> A common error to encounter is to find that CMake cannot resolve
> its dependencies via [`find_package`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html)
>
> A convenient way to solve this is to use the [`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.24/envvar/CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.html)
> environment variable to augment CMake's package search paths.
>
> For example, to use [`conan`](https://docs.conan.io/en/1.46/installation.html)
> to resolve dependencies (as we do during internal development), run
> the following commands from the root of the repository prior to
> building:
>
> ```shell
> conan install -if .conan resources/build --build=missing
> export CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`pwd`/.conan/conan_paths.cmake
> ```
>
> (These commands assume a Linux host, translate as necessary).
>
> This installs OpenAssetIO's dependencies as described in
> `/resources/build/conanfile.py`, and allows CMake to deduce the
> locations via referencing the generated `conan_paths.cmake`.

The artifacts are installed to `/build/dist`. This default location can
be overridden by setting `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` prior to build.

By default, OpenAssetIO builds as a shared library. This can be
overridden by setting `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` prior to build.
If shared library builds are disabled, then the core library will
be built and installed as a static library, and statically linked into
the Python module.

In installing the Python module, OpenAssetIO creates a valid Python
package, placed at
`build/dist/lib/{python-version}/site-packages/openassetio`.

> **Note**
>
> When built this way, the `openassetio` Python package will not
> function unless the binary artifacts are also made available to your
> Python environment.
>

### Building via pip

OpenAssetIO can alternately be built and installed via `pip`, which may
be preferable to the exclusively Python focused developer. Check out the
repository, and from the root, run:

```shell
python -m pip install src/openassetio-python/package
```

This will automatically build and install the Python extension module
into your python environment, along with the Python sources. After this,
you should be able to simply `import openassetio` from your python shell.

> **Note**
>
> `pip install .` is not a substantially different operation to
> calling CMake directly as described above, (and as such, all the same
> dependency requirements apply).
>
> However, be aware that once the C++
> library is built, it is statically, rather than dynamically, linked
> into the python libraries, and is not usable as a standalone
> OpenAssetIO C++ library.
>
> This means that this method of building is only appropriate for the
> exclusively python focused developer. Anyone wishing to write
> non-python hosts or managers should build via the CMake method
> described above.

For users that wish to modify the Python sources and test their changes
without reinstalling, [editable installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs)
are also supported

```shell
python -m pip install --editable src/openassetio-python/package
```

### Sandboxed builds

For a more convenient "out of the box" build environments, OpenAssetIO
also provides several sandboxed build environments, which you can read
about [here](SANDBOXED_BUILDS.md).

## CMake options

OpenAssetIO provides several custom CMake options to control the
behaviour of the build.

| Option      | Description | Default |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | `ON` to build shared libraries. `OFF` to build static libraries. | `ON` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_PYTHON` | Additionally build python bindings | `ON` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_C` | Additionally build C bindings | `ON` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_TESTS` | Additionally build tests | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_PYTHON_TEST_VENV` | Automatically create environment when running tests | `ON` |
| `OPENASSETIO_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` | Treat compiler warnings as errors | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_IPO` | Enable Interprocedural Optimization, aka Link Time Optimization (LTO) | `ON` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` | Enable position independent code for static library builds | `ON` |
| `OPENASSETIO_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI` | When building under gcc, use the new C++11 library ABI | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_NEW_DTAGS` | Set RUNPATH, overriding RPATH, on linux platforms | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_COVERAGE` | Enable coverage reporting for gcc/clang | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_SANITIZER_ADDRESS` | Enable address sanitizer | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_SANITIZER_LEAK` | Enable leak sanitizer | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_SANITIZER_UNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR`   | Enable undefined behavior sanitizer | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_SANITIZER_THREAD` | Enable thread sanitizer | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_SANITIZER_MEMORY` | Enable memory sanitizer | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY` | Enable clang-tidy analysis during build | `OFF` |
| `OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_CPPLINT` |Enable cpplint linter during build | `OFF` |

### Presets

To avoid managing these configuration variables manually, we include
several CMake [presets](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/blob/main/CMakePresets.json)
for common build configurations.
We recommend the `dev` preset be used for day-to-day development, whilst
the `test` preset provides comprehensive coverage of all components.

## Running tests

Testing is disabled by default and must be enabled by setting the
`OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_TESTS` CMake variable.

In addition, test fixtures are configured such that a Python environment
is created during the test run. This can be disabled by setting
`OPENASSETIO_ENABLE_PYTHON_TEST_VENV` to `OFF`. If this is `OFF` then
you must ensure the additional [test dependencies](#test-dependencies)
are installed manually.

Assuming that the working directory is the repository root, we can
configure the CMake build as follows

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -DOPENASSETIO_ENABLE_TESTS=ON
```

### Using `ctest`

The steps required to bootstrap an environment and execute the tests are
conveniently wrapped by CTest - CMake's built-in test runner. In order
to execute the tests, from the root of the repository run

```shell
ctest --test-dir build
```

This will build and install binary artifacts and Python sources, create
a Python environment, install test dependencies, then execute the tests.
