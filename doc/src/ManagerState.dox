 * @page stable_resolution Stable Entity Resolution
 *
 * @section stable_resolution_overview Overview
 * One of the main design principles of the @ref ManagerInterface is
 * that it should be stateless, in the sense that any session state is
 * held by the caller and supplied to the manager as part of the method
 * signature. This is to allow multi-threaded access to the @ref ManagerInterface
 * and avoid the need for any additional internal state to exist within
 * its implementation. The @ref openassetio.hostAPI.Manager "Manager"
 * class wraps the interface implementation to help the @ref host
 * with basic session state management.
 *
 * Many common use cases require multiple calls to the API to complete a
 * task. Several textures need to be published together, or multiple
 * frames of a render need to be distributed to a render-farm.
 *
 * If a manager wants to support the concept of a @ref meta_version, it
 * becomes essential that there is some way for the manager to know that
 * disparate calls to the API are part of the same conceptual action, so
 * that the resolution of references is stable.
 *
 * To achieve this, we introduce the idea of a @ref
 * manager_state token.
 *
 * @note Generating a state token is optional for the manager. However,
 * without one, it is not possible to know if any two API calls are
 * being made from a related process.
 *
 * @section stable_resolution_manager_state Manager State
 *
 * The manager state mechanism allows a @ref manager to embed state
 * within the @ref host, such that it can correlate API calls.
 *
 * Whenever a @ref Context is created by the host, the
 * @ref openassetio.managerAPI.ManagerInterface.ManagerInterface.createState
 * "ManagerInterface.createState" method will be called, and the
 * returned token stored in the Context's @ref openassetio.Context.Context.managerInterfaceState
 * "managerInterfaceState" property.
 *
 * @startuml
 * actor host
 * host -> Session : createContext()
 * Session -> Manager : _createState()
 * Manager -> ManagerInterface : createState(hostSession)
 * ManagerInterface -> ManagerInterface : __createSnapshotToken()
 * ManagerInterface --> Manager : token
 * Manager --> Session : token
 * Session -> Session : new Context()
 * Session -> Session : context.managerInterfaceState = token
 * Session --> host : context
 * ...
 * host -> Manager : register(..., context)
 * Manager -> ManagerInterface : register(..., context, hostSession)
 * ManagerInterface -> ManagerInterface : state = context.managerInterfaceState
 * ...
 * @enduml
 *
 * @warning The host must treat the token as being opaque, and is solely
 * responsible for managing the lifetime of each Context such that it is
 * re-used for logically correlated series of actions. The API
 * middleware takes care of requesting and persisting the state token.
 *
 * @section stable_resolution_manager_state_distribution Distributed processing
 *
 * Distributed processing requires the same context to be shared by
 * multiple discrete working processes.
 *
 * The @ref openassetio.hostAPI.transactions.TransactionCoordinator
 * "TransactionCoordinator's" @ref openassetio.hostAPI.transactions.TransactionCoordinator.freezeManagerState
 * "freezeManagerState" and @ref openassetio.hostAPI.transactions.TransactionCoordinator.thawManagerState
 * "thawManagerState" methods provide a mechanism by which a @ref host
 * can obtain a portable version of the manager's state token for a
 * given context for distribution to other processes that are logically
 * connected.

 *
 * This mechanism allows for distributed API calls to be anchored to
 * specific snapshot of a manager's view of the world. It is not
 * intended to be used to group discrete publishing actions into a
 * batch. This is covered by the separate transaction API.
 *
 * The reason for this is that a host may need to perform multiple
 * independent transactions during the lifetime of a single context.
 *
 * @section stable_resolution_manager_state_guidelines Implementation Guidelines
 *
 * - Because a thawed state may be passed to multiple child processes,
 *   the manager must be prepared for the state to be restored more than once, at
 *   the same time.
 *
 * - The current transaction state is encoded in the token. A @ref host
 *   is responsible for making sure that in a distributed context
 *   scenario, where the same state is used in multiple processes, no
 *   @ref transactions_action_groups are pushed/popped in these parallel
 *   contexts such that a transaction would be started, cancelled or
 *   finished. In other words, the Host must ensure that there is only
 *   ever, globally, a single instance of any particular state object
 *   when controlling a transaction - either manually, or via an action
 *   group. This is to ensure that the transaction state does not
 *   become inconsistent across threads/processes.
