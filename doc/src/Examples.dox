 * @page examples Examples
 *
 * @note This section is a work-in-progress. Over time we will add
 * flow diagrams for key operations that happen through the API, along
 * with more extensive sample implementations for both @ref host "hosts"
 * and @ref manager "managers". Currently it is limited to illustrating a
 * few common operations that a host of the API may perform.
 *
 * @warning At this stage, until we ship a sample manager
 * implementation, the code for later examples won't actually function.
 *
 * @section examples_api_initialization Initializing the API in a Host
 *
 * This example covers the steps required to initialize the API within a
 * @ref host "'host'" tool, script or application that wishes to
 * interact with an @ref asset_management_system.
 *
 * It makes use of the @ref openassetio.pluginSystem "Plugin System" to
 * discover available @ref ManagerPlugin "ManagerPlugins".
 *
 * It also includes a bare-minimum example of a @ref
 * openassetio.hostAPI.HostInterface "HostInterface" implementation.
 *
 * @code{.py}
 * from openassetio.logging import ConsoleLogger, SeverityFilter
 * from openassetio.hostAPI import HostInterface, Manager, Session
 * from openassetio.pluginSystem import PluginSystemManagerFactory
 *
 * class ExampleHost(HostInterface):
 *     """
 *     A minimal host implementation with no document model.
 *     """
 *     def identifier(self):
 *         return "org.openassetio.example.host"
 *
 *
 *     def displayName(self):
 *         return "OpenAssetIO Example Host"
 *
 * # For simplicity, use a filtered console logger, this logs to
 * # std::out/err based on the value of FOUNDRY_ASSET_LOGGING_SEVERITY.
 * # Practically you may wish to provide a bridge to your own logging
 * # mechanism if you have one.
 * logger = SeverityFilter(ConsoleLogger())
 *
 * # We need to provide the mechanism by which managers are created, the
 * # built-in plugin system allows these to be loaded from
 * # FOUNDRY_ASSET_PLUGIN_PATH.
 * factory = PluginSystemManagerFactory(logger)
 *
 * # We then need out implementation of the HostInterface class
 * host_interface = ExampleHost()
 *
 * # We can now start a session with OpenAssetIO. The Session is
 * # the heart of all our interactions with a the API. It allows
 * # us to query the available managers, and pick one to talk to.
 * session = Session(host_interface, logger, factory)
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section examples_picking_a_manager Setting up a Manager
 *
 * This example makes use of the newly initialized session to show how to
 * configure a @ref session to use a specific manager (it assumes that
 * some example @ref asset_management_system has a plugin, installed on
 * @ref plugin_path_var).
 *
 * We will be providing an example manager implementation soon!
 *
 * @code{.py}
 * managers = session.registeredManagers()
 * > {
 * >    'org.openassetio.example.manager': {
 * >         'name': 'Example Asset Manager',
 * >         'identifier': 'org.openassetio.example.manager',
 * >         'info': {},
 * >         'plugin': <class '5709f502e48331b76857b0f7274cbcf5.ExampleManagerPlugin'>
 * >    }
 * > }
 *
 * # We then tell the session which manager we'd like to use.
 * # Each session can only communicate with one manager at once.
 * # If we wanted to bridge between two, we'd create two sessions.
 * session.useManager('org.openassetio.example.manager')
 *
 * # At this point the manager hasn't yet been initialized. This is
 * # done lazily when it's first needed. This might seem odd here, but
 * # it makes life easier in practice in real-world integrations as often
 * # numerous call sites may wish to obtain access to the manager.
 * manager = session.currentManager()
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section examples_resolving_a_reference Resolving a reference
 *
 * This example shows how to use the instantiated manager to resolve a
 * string that may be an entity reference - covering use of the correct
 * context and a custom @ref locale to describe the call site.
 *
 * @info Note how it is the callers responsibility to validate
 * that a string is a @ref entity_reference before passing it to any
 * other OAIO API that expects one.
 *
 * This is to reduce the validation overhead in the manager's
 * implementation of the API. This affords significant gains in
 * real-world production use cases where thousands of references
 * may be operated upon in time-critical scenarios.
 *
 * The API middleware provides assorted short-circuit validation
 * optimisations that can reduce the number of inter-language hops
 * required. See @ref
 * openassetio.managerAPI.ManagerInterface.ManagerInterface.info
 * "ManagerInterface.info" and the <tt>kField_EntityReferenceMatch*</tt>
 * keys.
 *
 * @code{.py}
 * from openassetio import Context
 * from openassetio.specifications import LocaleSpecification
 *
 * class APIDocumentationExampleLocale(LocaleSpecification):
 *     """
 *      A locale to represent code run as part of a documentation example
 *     """
 *     _type = "documentation.example"
 *
 * # We must **ALWAYS** validate that a string is an entity reference
 * # before passing it to any other manager API call.
 * if not manager.isEntityReference(some_string):
 *    raise ValueError(f'"{some_string}" isn't an entity reference.')
 *
 * # All calls to the manager must have a Context, these should always
 * # be created by the session, so that state is properly managed.
 * context = session.createContext()
 *
 * # We describe what we want to do with the asset
 * context.access = context.kRead
 *
 * # We tell the manager something about which part of our code is
 * # working with the asset.
 * context.locale = APIDocumentationExampleLocale()
 *
 * # We describe the lifetime of the returned reference
 * # as persistent retention may require a more stable value.
 * context.retention = context.kTransient
 *
 * # We can now resolve a token we may have if it is a reference.
 * resolved_asset = manager.resolveEntityReference(some_string, context)
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section example_publishing_a_file Publishing a file
 *
 * This example demonstrates how an API host should involve the manager in
 * the creation of new data. In this case, a simple text file.
 *
 * @code{.py}
 * from openassetio import constants
 * from openassetio.specifications import FileSpecification
 *
 * # We first need to describe the kind of entity we're about
 * # to publish. It's going to be a text file. In reality you
 * # would use one of the more derived, concrete specification types.
 * file_spec = FileSpecification()
 * file_spec.extensions = ('txt',)
 *
 * # As ever, an appropriately configured context is required
 * context = session.createContext()
 * context.access = context.kWrite
 * context.locale = APIDocumentationExampleLocale()
 *
 * # The first step is to see if the manager wants to manage text files
 * policy = manager.managementPolicy(file_spec, context)
 *
 * if not policy & constants.kManaged:
 *   # The manager doesn't care about this type of asset
 *   return
 *
 * # Not all managers can tell us where to put files (irksome).
 * # The reality of handling this is somewhat more challenging, and
 * # depends on the nature of the task in hand. One for further discussion.
 * save_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'greeting.txt')
 *
 * # Whenever we make new data, we always tell the manager first,
 * # This allows it to create a placeholder version or similar.
 * # NOTE: It is critical to always use the working_ref from now on.
 * working_ref = manager.preflight(entity_ref, file_spec, context)
 *
 * # We then check if the manager can tell us where to save the file
 * if policy & constants.kWillManagePath:
 *     save_path = manager.resolveEntityReference(working_ref, context)
 *
 * # Now we can write the file
 * with open(save_path, 'w') as f:
 *    f.write("Hello from the documentation example\n")
 *
 * # Now the data has been written, we register the file and the publish
 * # is complete. Update the context retention to denote that we're going
 * # to save a reference to this entity in our user's history.
 * context.retention = context.kPermanent
 * final_ref = manager.register(save_path, working_ref, file_spec, context)
 *
 * # We can persist this reference as we used the kPermanent retention
 * with open(os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'history', 'a') as f:
 *     f.write(f"{final_ref}\n")
 * @endcode
