# The contribution process

This project operates a Pull Request model, using the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
approach. The rough outline is as follows:

0. Ensure there is a suitable [CLA](#contribution-sign-off) in place for
   you, or your organization
1. Chat with the Trusted Committers and community to define the scope of
   work
2. Fork the repo, and work in a branch
3. Create a Pull Request for Code Review
4. Address any comments
5. Work is merged

The main aim of the process is to keep people in the loop - avoiding any
surprises later on. This helps avoid churn/frustration for all involved.

## Defining the scope of work

The first stage defines a shared understanding of what work is to be
done, this should always be done in conjunction with the project's
Trusted Committers. The steps are:

1. Ensure you can describe the nature of your request or change, along
   with real-world use cases any why it is desirable.
2. Create a thread in the project [discussions](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/discussions/categories/ideas-and-change-proposals)
   area that describes the topic, this is to ensure:
    - There isn't any overlapping work already planned or in progress.
    - The change makes sense as part of any broader vision for the
      project.
    - There is agreement on next steps, which may include research
      and/or design phases.
3. Along with the trusted committers, create an issue using the
   What/Why/Acceptance Criteria outline that covers the definition of
   done for the work
4. Review the planned work with the team, and agree a testing strategy
   and target branch.
5. Trusted Committers will be assigned to review the work through to
   delivery.

## Development

We have a few golden rules for commits to release branches:

- All code should follow the project coding standards.
- `main` and maintenance branches should always be functional, they must
  always be release ready.
- Commits should form meaningful atomic units of change. The build
  should never be (intentionally) broken between commits merged to
  release branches.
- Fix bugs in the oldest branch and merge forwards, do not cherry-pick
  back.
- All Pull Requests must be reviewed by someone who did not write the
  code.

### Working process

The process for feature development is as follows (we use the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) process):

1. Create a fork of the repository, and a working branch and begin work.
     - Keep the appropriate Trusted Committers in the loop with
       regarding any in-flight issues.
     - Request in-progress reviews if necessary to validate design
       choices by creating a [WIP PR](PULL_REQUESTS.md#wip-prs) and
       @-ing a Trusted Committer.
     - Branches should be named using the
       `work/<issueNumber>-<camelCaseTitle>` convention.
2. Upon completion, prepare your Pull Request in accordance with the
   [Pull Request guidelines](PULL_REQUESTS.md), for larger work, this
   may be targeted at a feature branch, rather than a release branch.
3. Address any feedback with `fixup!` commits, creating a separate
   commit for each comment thread.
4. Once approved, rebase and squash any `fixups!` or `squash!` commits
   authored as separate commits to ease review and re-request a review.
5. The Pull Request will be merged *by a reviewer* into the target
   branch.

> IMPORTANT: You should never merge your own PR unless instructed to by
> the reviewer.

### Coding standards

The mix of languages used in this project means there are some important
guidelines on how to format code and documentation written for the
project. These are outlined in the [coding style](CODING_STYLE.md) and
[coding standards](CODING_STANDARDS.md) guides.

### Change log

The Change Log should always be updated during development work, rather
than at release time. This ensures it is consistent with the code base
and that change notes are written at the time of greatest understanding.

Any commit that makes a user facing change should update the log. See
the [Recording user facing changes in the release notes](CHANGES.md)
section for more details. This includes otherwise invisible changes that
cause source or binary incompatibilities.

### Contribution sign off

OpenAssetIO is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](../../LICENSE).
All contributions to the project must abide by that license.

Contributions to OpenAssetIO require the use of the [Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org).
All commits must be signed-off as follows, before merge, to indicate
that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: Jóna Jónsdóttir <jona.jonsdottir@example.com>
```

This can be added automatically to a commit using `git commit -s`.

We also require commits to be [GPG signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).

In addition, contributors are required to complete either the Individual
or Corporate Contribution License Agreement. Please contact one of the
trusted committers for more information.

### Release process

OpenAssetIO releases are managed via git tags, and make use of [SemVer](https://semver.org).
All components within the same repository share a version, and will be
released together.

To make a new OpenAssetIO release, follow this procedure.

- Create a work branch in a forked repository.
- Update [`RELEASE_NOTES.md`](../../RELEASE_NOTES.md) version placeholder
  to be the concrete release number. (For example, change v1.0.x
  to v1.0.1).
- Update version numbers in :
  - [pyproject.toml](../../src/openassetio-python/pyproject.toml)
    (under `[project]` section).
  - [version.hpp.in](../../cmake/templates/include/openassetio/version.hpp.in)
    (for changes to/from pre-releases only, append the pre-release tag
    to `OPENASSETIO_VERSION_STRING`).
  - [test_version.py](../../src/openassetio-python/tests/package/test_version.py)
    (at the top).
  - [CMakeLists.txt](../../CMakeLists.txt)
    (an argument to `project()`, no need to update for a pre-release
    increment).
- If there is an ABI change (major release), update
  `set(_core_abi_version X)` in
  [`src/openassetio-core/CMakeLists.txt`](../../src/openassetio-core/CMakeLists.txt)
  to the new major version - regardless of it's previous value (this may
  skip values).
- Commit changes using the title: `[Release] Bump version to <version>`.
- Have a final scan over the release notes to check for typos. If any
  are spotted, add a commit *before* the version bump to fix them.
- Create a PR into the primary repo and await review.
- Check if this release must occur simultaneously with a release of
  another project in the OpenAssetIO ecosystem, and if so ensure they
  are also ready to release before continuing.
- Merge the release PR to `main` as normal.

> **Warning**
>
> Upon merging to main, several actions will kickoff against your merge
> commit. Notable among these is
> [Build wheels](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/actions/workflows/build-wheels.yml),
> which makes the python release artifacts available for upload, by the
> [Deploy PyPI](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/actions/workflows/deploy-pypi.yml)
> action.
>
> The [Build wheels](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/actions/workflows/build-wheels.yml)
> action must be successfully run before a release is created. Wait
> until this action is finished before continuing on.

- Now the codebase is all set up, create a [new Release](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/releases/new)
  in GitHub.
  - Set the tag to be the version number with a `v` prefix, eg
    `v1.0.1`, you should be creating a new tag.
  - Set the title to be the same as the tag, eg `v1.0.1`.
  - Copy the release notes for this release into the description:
    - Do not include the version title.
    - Remove line wrapping from the release notes, each note
      should becomes a single line.
      (vim users: `set tw=9999`, `gg<S-V><S-G>gq`)
  - If this is a pre-release, ensure `Set as a pre-release` checkbox is
    checked.
  - Click "Publish Release"
- In response to a release being published, two things happen.
  - The [Deploy PyPI](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/actions/workflows/deploy-pypi.yml)
    action will be invoked. Monitor this to ensure PyPI wheels are
    uploaded correctly.
  - The [Upload release builds](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/actions/workflows/upload-release-builds.yml)
    action will be invoked, building a wider than usual matrix of of
    openassetio artifacts, and then uploading them to the release page.
- You're done! Take a break and relax!

## Breaking the application binary interface (ABI)

OpenAssetIO is a C++ library, and as such, it is important to manage ABI
changes carefully. We use [tooling to detect ABI
changes](../../resources/abi/README.md). When a deliberate and
non-binary compatible change occurs, the release notes should be updated
to [document this](CHANGES.md), even if there is no other user facing
change.

## Breaking integrations

OpenAssetIO is pursuing an integration heavy validation strategy, it
seeks to have a set of robust proof of concept projects, and will use
these as both design validators and testing coverage providers.

In order to tie this coverage into mainline OpenAssetIO development,
OpenAssetIO continuous integration checks out several downstream
projects each time a commit is pushed. These projects are built against
the bleeding edge version of OpenAssetIO, and their test suites are run.
This provides valuable end to end testing of each changeset, and is
invaluable. (See
[integrations.yml](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO/blob/main/.github/workflows/integrations.yml))

Furthermore, as these downstream repos are projects in their own right,
they also have their own CI suites to validate any changes made to them,
using a released OpenAssetIO version, taken from PyPI.

### Breaking change mitigation process

On occasion, it is necessary for OpenAssetIO to change its interfaces in
such a way that cause the downstream projects to become incompatible
against the bleeding edge OpenAssetIO. You will know when this happens
as one of the tests in
[integrations.yml](../../.github/workflows/integrations.yml) will begin
to fail.

The downstream projects are pinned to a specific version of OpenAssetIO
on PyPI for their own test suites, so these will continue to function
even through a breaking change on OpenAssetIO main. However, the
OpenAssetIO integrations checks will being to fail, with no clear way to
remedy the situation before an OpenAssetIO release, as any changes to
the downstream project to support bleeding edge will likely cause
incompatibility with the published OpenAssetIO release the project is
consuming from PyPI.

In order to remedy this, when making a breaking OpenAssetIO change that
causes a failing integrations check, the following procedure may be
implemented to avoid long term loss of coverage.

1. Consult on whether the change must necessarily be breaking, if
   reasonably possible, attempt to formulate another approach.

2. Evaluate the scope of breakage in the dependent project(s), and make
   an issue in those projects to fix compatibility with your change.

3. Comment out the failing integrations check in
   [integrations.yml](../../.github/workflows/integrations.yml). Leave a
   note explaining the context, with links to the issues created in the
   previous step.

4. Review and merge your change to OpenAssetIO as normal, call out the
   removed integrations check in the PR.

5. As soon as possible, plan to work on the issues(s) created in step 2
   to return compatibility to the dependent repos.

6. To accomplish this, branch the dependent repo in question from main,
   call your new branch `openassetio/X.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` is the *next*
   release of OpenAssetIO.

   > **Warning**
   >
   > The specific branch name formatting is important, as CI is setup to
   > source wheels built from the tip of `openassetio:main` when run on
   > these  branches.
   >
   > If this is the first time this process is being
   > actioned on a specific repo, the CI steps to source wheels on
   > release branches may not have been set up yet, consult with the
   > team on how to introduce them.

7. Fix the project to function with the new interface. Review and Merge
   to the `openassetio/X.Y.Z` branch.

8. Re-enable the disabled integration tests in OpenAssetIO by
   re-targeting the checkout in
   [integrations.yml](../../.github/workflows/integrations.yml) to point
   to this new branch. It should now pass.

9. When OpenAssetIO has its next release, fold these branches back into
   the main branches.

10. Re-target
    [integrations.yml](../../.github/workflows/integrations.yml) back to
    normal, checking out the `main` branch of the dependent repos.

11. Delete the `openassetio/X.Y.Z` staging branch.

This process is presented as an alternate to either leaving the broken
integration removed from the main OpenAssetIO test suite until such a
time as a release can be made and the changes can be reintegrated, or
immediately having to fix any breakages in dependent projects as part
of any breaking change in OpenAssetIO.
