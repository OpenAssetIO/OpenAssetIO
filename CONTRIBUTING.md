# Contributing

This project operates a Pull Request model, using the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) approach. The rough outline is as follows:

1. Chat with the Trusted Committers and community to define the scope of work
2. Fork the repo, and work in a branch
3. Create a Pull Request for Code Review
4. Address any comments
5. Work is merged

The main aim of the process is to keep people in the loop - avoiding any surprises later on. This helps avoid churn/frustration for all involved.

More details on the development process will be provided soon. In the meantime, please open an Issue or contact one of the Trusted Committers.
