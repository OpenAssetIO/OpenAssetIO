# OpenAssetIO

An open-source interoperability standard for tools and content
management systems used in media production.

It aims to reduce integration and maintenance overhead in modern
production pipelines.

`OpenAssetIO` enabled tools and asset management systems can freely
communicate with each other, without needing to know any specifics of
their respective implementations.

## Scope

The API covers the following areas:
 - Resolution of asset references (URIs) into locatable data (URLs).
 - Publishing and retrieval of data for file-based and non-file-based
   'assets'.
 - Discovery and registration of related assets.
 - Replacement/augmentation of in-application UI elements such as 
   browsers and other panels/controls.

The API builds upon the production-tested [Katana Asset API](https://learn.foundry.com/test/katana/4.0/Content/tg/asset_management_system_plugin_api/asset_management_system.html), 
addressing several common integration challenges and adding support
for a wider range of asset types and publishing workflows.

## Project status

> **Important:** The project is currently in early beta stage and is 
> subject to change. Do not deploy the API in production critical 
> situations without careful thought.

We are currently working towards a v1.0.0 release. At present, the API 
is sketched in pure `Python`, whilst some structural revisions are being
made. Once the surface area has stabilised, the Core API will be ported
to `C++` with bindings to `Python`.

The code is presented here in its current form to facilitate discussion
and early-adopter testing. We actively encourage engagement in the 
[discussion](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/discussions)
and to give feedback on current [Issues](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/issues)
and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/pulls).

We have been making some structural changes prior to migrating to this
repository, updating from Python 2 to Python 3 and removing some
spurious/legacy concepts. There may well be some rough edges so bear
with us whilst we get things ship-shape.

Please see the [project board](https://github.com/TheFoundryVisionmongers/OpenAssetIO/projects/1)
for work in progress, as well as up-coming topics.

## Background

Within the Media and Entertainment sector, digital content (such as
images, models and editorial data) is usually managed by a central
catalog. This catalog is commonly known as an "Asset Management System",
and forms a singular source of truth for a project.

OpenAssetIO provides an abstraction layer that generalises the dialog
between a 'host' (eg. a Digital Content Creation application such as
Maya&reg; or Nuke) and one of these systems - a 'manager' (eg. ShotGrid,
ftrack or other proprietary systems).

This project first began in 2013, taking inspiration from the production
tested [Katana Asset API](https://learn.foundry.com/test/katana/4.0/Content/tg/asset_management_system_plugin_api/asset_management_system.html)
to make it more suitable for a wider variety of uses. Modern pipelines
are incredibly nuanced. Finding a common framework that brings value in
this space is challenging to say the least. Prototypes built during the
development of `OAIO` over the last few years have demonstrated
significant developer and artist value.

We hope the API forms a practical starting point that addresses many
real-world use cases, and as an industry, we can evolve the standard
over time to support any additional requirements. We are currently
investigating the relationship with [Ar 2.0](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/docs/668045551.html), 
which appears to overlap with a subset of `OAIO`s concerns.
